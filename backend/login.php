/*these are some of the functions needed for login:
    create log in pages for librian and borrower. include hash-passwords. delete 
    user accounts.

 *  I was also thinking log in pages would only be needed for specific librarian
 *  pages and borrower pages. for instance everyone should be able to view and
 * use the search catalogue page. on the seach catalogue there should be to links
 *one for the borrower to view their account and one for the librarian to
 * view their admin bits. only with the admin pages do we need to validate sessions.
 * the validation code for that is in admin.php. Hope thats okay.
